## 💡 What is this?

RAG Radar continuously monitors GitHub for newly published retrieval-augmented generation projects, libraries, and production patterns. It scores and categorizes discoveries by component type (chunking, embedding, retrieval, generation) and outputs a structured feed developers can subscribe to or browse. Powered by GitHub Actions and the GitHub Search API.

This list is **auto-updated every 15 minutes** by a GitHub Actions cron.
Each commit reflects a real change in the upstream data source — new items added,
expired items removed — so you can rely on what you see being current.

## 📋 Current Items

> ⏰ Last updated: _pending first run_

<!-- TRACKER_TABLE_START -->
_The first cron run will populate this section._
<!-- TRACKER_TABLE_END -->

## 🔍 How it works

Every 15 minutes, a GitHub Action runs `tracker.py`. That script:

1. Fetches the latest state from `GitHub Search API`.
2. Diffs against `data/items.json` (the previous snapshot).
3. Rewrites the table above between the `<!-- TRACKER_TABLE_* -->` markers.
4. Commits `feat: +N added, -M removed (timestamp)` if anything changed.

No external services. No paid APIs. Just a public data source and a free GitHub Action.

## 🤝 Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` — usually you don't need to: the tracker keeps itself current.
If you spot a data-source bug or want to suggest a new column for the table, open
an issue.
